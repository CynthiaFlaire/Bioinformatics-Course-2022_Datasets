# Bioinformatics Course 2022 Datasets
This repo contains the individual project datasets for all students who partook in Dr. Serghei Mangul's 2022 bioinformatics course.

These datasets were simulated from the SRA records published by Arunachalam et al. as part of their study, [Systems biological assessment of immunity to mild versus severe COVID-19 infection in humans](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abc6261).
Specifically, a transcript expression matrix generated from the study's SRA records served as the main input into the `simulate_experiment_empirical` function from the R package [_polyester_](https://github.com/alyssafrazee/polyester).

Each folder in this repo contains two subfolders: COVID and Healthy. These store simulated RNA-Seq data for COVID-19 infected and healthy persons respectively.
